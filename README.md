# Mental Arithmetic Game

Please read these instructions before using the program.

**Description:**

The function of this program is to help the user improve his mental arithmetic skills. To reach an improvement the program will randomly generate calculations for the user to solve. Additionally there will be different game-modes and difficulty settings from which the user can choose from to make sure that the program can help everyone from beginner to pro with their mental arithmetic skills.

**How to use:**

Select the game mode:

  • Speedrun: In this game mode the user has to solve ten calculations right as fast as he can. The program will start the clock when it shows the user the first numbers and stop the time when the user successfully solves his tenth calculation

•	Timer: In this game mode the user must solve as many calculations right as he can before the timer runs out. Depending the difficulty setting the timer will be set either at 60 seconds or 90 seconds

Choose the difficulty setting:

•	Easy: The program will randomly choose two numbers in the range of 1 to 10 for the user to multiply. Additionally, in the game mode timer the user will have the timer set at 60 seconds with this difficulty setting.

•	Hard: The program will randomly choose two numbers in the range of 10 to 30 for the user to multiply. Additionally, in the game mode timer the user will have the timer set at 90 seconds with this difficulty setting.

Track your progress: 

•	If the user chooses the hard difficulty setting in either game mode he/she will be able to save his/her score in a leaderboard. This functions allows the user to track the process made up to this point. The file is saved on the drive of the user, that he/she can open and close the code and keep the leaderboard.

**Execution of code:**

1.	Randomly selects two integers in a given range and shows them to the user
2.	Multiplies the two integers and compares answer to users guess
3.	Checks if the limits of game mode is reached or if the game ends
4.	Continues or breaks the loop
5.	Allows the user to save the result in a leaderboard
6.	Allows the user to open the leaderboard


--> Enjoy the game! :)
